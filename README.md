# SCS_Book_Bank
A simple app to manage book bank.

This is a simple app to be used as a book bank or library managment with google sheets and documents linked to it. It is a simple version and will surely help new android learners get the basic design elements right.

I have implemented card view with browser intent linked to it. Also edit text and splash screen is being used here.
